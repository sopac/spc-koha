<h1>Budgets</h1>

<p>Budgets are used for tracking accounting values related to acquisitions. For example you could create a Budget for the current year (ex. 2012) and then break that into Funds for different areas of the library (ex. Books, Audio, etc).</p>

<p>When visiting the main budget administration you will see two tabs, one for active and one for inactive budgets.</p>

<h2>Add a budget</h2>

<p>Budgets can either be created from scratch or by duplicating the previous year's budget.</p>

<p>To duplicate a budget from a previous year, click on the link for the budget name from the list of budgets.</p>

<p>On the screen listing the budget breakdown click the Edit button at the top and choose to Duplicate budget.</p>

<p>You will be presented with a form where you simply need to enter the new start and end date and save the budget.</p>

<p>This will not only duplicate your budget, but all of the funds associated with that budget so that you can reuse budgets and funds from year to year.</p>

<p>If you haven't used Koha before for acquisitions then you'll need to start fresh with a new budget. To add a new budget click the 'New Budget' button.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Choose the time period this budget is for, whether it's an academic year, a fiscal year, a quarter, etc.</li>

    <li>The Description should be something that will help you identify the budget when ordering</li>

    <li>In the amount box do not use any symbols, simply enter the amount of the budget with numbers and decimals.</li>

    <li>Marking a budget active makes it usable when placing orders in the acquisitions module, even if the order is placed after the budget end date. This will allow you to record orders that were places in a previous budget period.</li>

    <li>Locking a budget means that Funds will not be able to be modified by librarians</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you have made your edits, click the 'Save Changes' button. You will be brought to a list of your existing budgets.</p>
