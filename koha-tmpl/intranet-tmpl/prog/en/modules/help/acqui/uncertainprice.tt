<h1>Uncertain prices</h1>

<p>The Uncertain Prices page is independent of the basket. It is linked to the vendor so you will see all items on order with uncertain prices for that vendor.</p>

<p><strong>See the full documentation for Uncertain prices in the <a href="http://manual.koha-community.org/3.10/en/placingacqorder.html#createacqbasket">manual</a> (online).</strong></p>
