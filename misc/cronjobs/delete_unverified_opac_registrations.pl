This script removes unconfirmed OPAC based patron registrations
that have not been confirmed within the required time period.

This script has the following parameters :
    -h --help:    This message

    -t --time:    The length in hours to wait before removing an unconfirmed registration.
                  Defaults to 24 hours if not set.

    -c --confirm: Without this flag set, this script will do nothing.
